# wackamole-React

This is a React version of my wackamole project. This one only supports touch and mouse clicks unlike the javascript only version where it is keyboard only.

I'm new to react so the optimization at the moment is currently poor and animations are laggy.

Note: Currently the Game has no sounds, and there are no indicatiors for the 3.5 seconds delay/ready time before the game starts.
